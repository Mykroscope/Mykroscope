Emerging as champion of the Young Innovators Challenge 2017 (YIC) has enabled Sekolah Agama Menengah Jeram to turn their idea into reality. Their idea, the Mykroscope, is the pairing of a portable microscope with a smartphone. Mykroscope allows students to capture their discoveries on their mobile phones and share them with others around the world. With Mykroscope, students are no longer bound by the confines of their classrooms; the world is now their classroom.


You can use our app or your own camera to operate the Mykroscope.
