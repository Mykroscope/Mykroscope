Emerging as champion of the Young Innovators Challenge 2017 (YIC) has enabled Sekolah Agama Menengah Jeram to turn their idea into reality. Their idea, the Mykroscope, is the pairing of a portable microscope with a smartphone. Mykroscope allows students to capture their discoveries on their mobile phones and share them with others around the world. With Mykroscope, students are no longer bound by the confines of their classrooms; the world is now their classroom.

To operate the Mykroscope, you will need a Mykroscope cardboard set, and a smartphone.
Easily use your phone camera and capture the cell image under Mykroscope, then share it to your friends around the world.

1) Download the blueprint in "Cutting Files" folder
2) Follow the Mykroscope Manual to build your Mykroscope.

    *** View Mykroscope BOM spreadsheet for the component list ***
    
3) Launch your camera, place it on top on the Mykroscope and start your discoveries.
